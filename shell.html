		<h1>Mutts Are The Best Dogs</h1>
		<p>If you’re considering getting a <b>purebred</b> dog and shelling out a lot of money for a companion, take a moment to read this list and see why you should maybe consider getting a <b>mutt</b> instead.</p>
		<p>Mutts tend to be healthier and live longer than purebred dogs. Mutts are generally perceived as more likable than purebred dogs, and for a good reason too. They tend to have a milder temperament, are less likely to snap or get cranky, not to mention tantrum fits and violent behavior. We are not sure about the science behind this and why it is so, but if you think about all the mutts you’ve met in your life and compare them to the purebred dogs you’ve met, you’ll probably agree. Mutts are often happier and more cheerful and playful than purebred dogs. They are known to be extremely affectionate, great cuddlers, amazing companions and friendly neighbors. Whether you save a mutt from a shelter or the street, as a puppy or as an adult dog, he will be grateful to you until the day he dies. When you bring a dog to your home and give him a brand new chance at life, it’s not something he can easily forget. That dog will show his gratitude, love and appreciation to you forever.</p>
